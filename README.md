# Introduction
Developed an IoT-based street light monitoring system operating in both automatic and manual modes to optimize energy savings during nighttime by dimming lights when no motion is detected.
Integrated LDR sensors for automatic light activation and deactivation, and PIR sensors for adjusting light intensity, controlled by relays and a servo-driven AC dimmer.
Implemented a comprehensive weather monitoring system to measure temperature, humidity, moisture, and pressure, providing real-time environmental data.
Enhanced security through CCTV surveillance integration, utilizing image processing techniques to analyze output images and ensure efficient monitoring.
